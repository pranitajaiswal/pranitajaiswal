- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pranita Jaiswal
- ðŸ‘€ With 6+ years of experience, I possess a strong understanding of the testing process and its effective execution. As an ETL Tester at IBM, Capgemini, and CitiusTech Healthcare Pvt Ltd, I have designed and implemented testing plans for data warehouse projects, ensuring accurate data extraction, transformation, and loading. I excel in writing custom SQL scripts to validate data integrity during ETL processing. My attention to detail ensures thorough testing, defect identification, and timely resolution before release, contributing to successful project launches.
